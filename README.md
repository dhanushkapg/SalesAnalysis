<h1>Sales Performance Analysis and Insights Using Power BI</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is aimed at enhancing my Power BI skills through a self-driven analysis of a sales dataset sourced from Kaggle. The focus is on generating actionable insights that meet specific business requirements, particularly for management.The objective is to analyze sales figures across various territories and cities, with a special emphasis on current sales performance. The analysis also extends to evaluating the performance of districts and district managers, offering a comprehensive view of sales dynamics across different geographical areas.
Through this project, I aim to develop proficiency in data modeling, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), and creating interactive dashboards in Power BI. The final deliverables will include a series of visual reports that enable management to monitor territory-based sales performance and district management efficiency in real time, driving strategic decision-making.
